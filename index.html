        <p><em>In case you’re wondering who is behind all of these…</em></p>
        <p>
          You can call me Tonie. ✌🏻😘 I am a Filipina based in Canada. I like
          coffee shops, rainy days, and sticky notes. ☕️☁️ I am a registered
          nurse in-the-making. 💉
        </p>

          My love for reading started with a Disney Fairytale book. 🧚🏻‍♀️ Since I
          was eight, I have been a fan of short stories, with
          <em>“The Little Match Girl” </em> as my first read. 📖 Through the
          years, I grew up close to reading as well as writing. ✍🏻 I started
          collecting books in 2014, with 65 books and counting. 📚✨ My
          favourite picks are YA Fiction, Romance, Fantasy, and Mystery. 🙌🏻👌🏻 I
          have tons of favourite authors, with Cassandra Clare, Marie Lu,
          Jasmine Warga, Holly Bourne, and Jonah Mae Pacala to top them all.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this day, I am still reading and discovering new stories. 😍 On my
          free time, I am either at the bookstore searching for a new release,
          or on a coffee shop rereading another favourite. 🤭⭐️ In between, I
          like to create poems and write my novels. 🪐⚡️ Aside from that, I am
          also into vlogging, photography, art, fashion, and travelling. 📸✈️
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess that sums it all up. Although I created this website as a
          project, I <em>still</em> wanted to work on something that I am
          interested and passionate about. 🪐💫Thus, I choose a book blog. In
          here, you will see my latest reads 🔎, favourite authors 💛, book
          reviews🎖, and so much more! 📚✨
        </p>
        <p>Feel free to discover my digital library! 👩‍💻💛</p>
